## Introduction

It replicates the method of [echo state neural network](https://github.com/andreaduggento/EchoState-GrangerCausality) in calculating nonlinear conditional Granger causality. This program is part of [Amazon molecule literature](https://github.com/cloudy-sfu/Amazon-molecule-literature), and includes methods using MATLAB.

## Usage

Run script 7 in [Amazon molecule literature](https://github.com/cloudy-sfu/Amazon-molecule-literature). Then, copy the output to `data/` folder in this program.

After getting the results, copy the output to `data/` folder in [Amazon molecule literature](https://github.com/cloudy-sfu/Amazon-molecule-literature).
